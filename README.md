The increasing importance of ecommerce websites lies in their ability to provide convenient and accessible shopping experiences for consumers while reducing the environmental impact of traditional brick-and-mortar retail. By eliminating the need for physical stores and reducing transportation emissions, ecommerce websites can help to reduce carbon footprints and improve sustainability. People can benefit from our ecommerce website project by enjoying a streamlined shopping experience from the comfort of their own homes, while also contributing to a more sustainable future.


Limitations and Possible Future Improvements:

• Storing a large amount of Employee, Products, Customers  data might be a bit tough.
